# Data Science: Time Series Analysis üìä‚è≥

Welcome to the **Data Science: Time Series Analysis** repository! This repository contains studies, projects, and hands-on experiments developed during the Data Science course at Alura. The primary focus is on **data analysis**, **predictive modeling**, and **applied statistics**, with a special emphasis on **time series analysis**.

## üìå Topics Covered  

### ‚úÖ **Data Preprocessing**  
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Techniques to handle messy data, including normalization, scaling, and encoding.  
- **Handling Missing Values and Outliers**: Strategies to impute missing data and detect/remove outliers for robust analysis.  

### ‚úÖ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Statistical Metrics and Visualizations**: Using descriptive statistics and visual tools to uncover insights.  
- **Identifying Patterns and Trends**: Analyzing data to detect seasonality, trends, and anomalies.  

### ‚úÖ **Statistical Hypothesis Testing**  
- **Formulating and Validating Hypotheses**: Designing experiments and testing assumptions.  
- **Applying Statistical Tests**: Using tests like t-tests, ANOVA, and chi-square to validate hypotheses.  

### ‚úÖ **Time Series Analysis and Forecasting**  
- **Understanding Temporal Patterns**: Decomposing time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals.  
- **Building Predictive Models**: Leveraging tools like **Prophet** and **ARIMA** for forecasting.  
- **Evaluating Model Performance**: Metrics such as **MAE**, **RMSE**, and **MAPE** to assess accuracy.  

### ‚úÖ **Advanced Techniques**  
- **Handling Outliers in Forecasting**: Advanced methods to mitigate the impact of outliers on predictions.  
- **Interactive Visualization**: Using libraries like **Plotly** and **Dash** for dynamic and interpretable visualizations.
